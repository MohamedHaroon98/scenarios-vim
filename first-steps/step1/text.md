Let's learn your first steps with the console based editor Vim!

1\. First open a new file:

```plain
vim my-file
```{{exec}}

2\. Next type `i` to get into the insert-mode. The mode is shown on bottom left

3\. Now type any text, like `hello world`!

4\. To get into command-mode press `Esc`{{}}

5\. To save the file we need to type `:x` and confirm with `Enter`{{}}

This will close Vim and we can view the newly created file:

```plain
cat my-file
```{{exec}}
